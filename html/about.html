            <h2>What is MailScrape?</h2>
            <p>
                MailScrape is our innovative new app which empowers you to protect 
                yourself from malicious emails. Mailscrape is fast and lightweight
                and can easily detect and notify you of any suspicious emails. Unlike 
                our competitors, MailScrape runs locally on your system, so your private 
                emails are never sent to anyone over the internet.

            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>
                MailScrape is made up of two basic components: a Chrome extension and 
                a Python application. The Chrome extension retrieves your emails and
                sends them to the Python app, which will then scan them for any links.
                If a link is found, it will query the link against a database of known malicious 
                websites. Your emails are not sent anywhereâ€”only the links found within are.
